=head1 NAME

MIME::Base64 - A Perl6 implementation of MIME::Base64 and friends

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Two libraries are available:

MIME::Base64

Implements encoding and decoding to and from base64 using an underlying
parrot library. This is a relatively fast implementation.

MIME::Base64::Perl

A horribly inefficient work in progress for doing the same thing as
MIME::Base64 in pure Perl 6 (what's currently available in Rakudo anyway).

=head1 STATUS

The Perl 6 version of MIME::Base64 is an experiment in Perl 6 and will
be replaced by a correct version when pack/unpack is available in the
Perl 6 core.
