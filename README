Two libraries are available:

  MIME::Base64

  Implements encoding and decoding to and from base64 using an underlying
  parrot library

  MIME::Base64::Perl

  A horribly inefficient work in progress for doing the same thing as
  MIME::Base64 in pure Perl 6 (what's currently available in Rakudo anyway)
